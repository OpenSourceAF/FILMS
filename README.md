Filament Inline Measurement System for 3D Printers

## Goals
- Make a stand-alone solution which measures the cross-sectional area of filament as it is fed into your existing 3D printer
- Run on a Raspberry Pi zero or cheaper
- Interface with as many firmwares as possible by only passing a percent change value to the printer over i2c or serial
- Keep the cost as low as possible
- Throw filament runout detection in there for free

## Techniques I will be trying:

- [Photo-Multigraph](https://dyingcharlotte.com/2017/04/12/photo-multigraphs-the-mirror-and-the-camera/) like mirror and camera setup. 
    - Maybe just multiple of the cheapest cameras I can source instead.
- Running the filament between latex sheets with a capacitive coating and sensor on the outside of the latex.


## How to help
- If you have any ideas or suggestions, please open an issue. 
- Donate time or money to The Open Source Appliance Foundation
  - We (well technically I) don't need funding for this project but any donations will go towards the development of other open source appliances.
